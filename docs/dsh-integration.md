# DSH integration

Dockyard DSH is a DSH-native plugin. The source entry is `packages/dsh-plugin/src/index.mjs`; the release entry is the bundled `packages/dsh-plugin/dist/index.mjs`. Both expose one shared `DockyardDshService` as `ctx.dockyard`, register the provider-neutral LLM adapter, and add the `/dockyard` human command through `ctx.commands`.

There is one source of truth inside the DSH process. The command service, model picker, and generation adapter all read the same runtime; none of them owns a second credential store, model list, quota cache, or account selector. A DSH stream goes through:

```text
DSH GenerateOptions
  -> Dockyard DSH adapter
  -> AccountPool policy
  -> provider module
  -> provider-native request transport (after browser OAuth import)
```

The native command surface is:

```text
/dockyard status
/dockyard scan [provider]
/dockyard add [provider] [candidateId]
/dockyard login <provider>
/dockyard refresh [provider]
/dockyard models <provider>
/dockyard policy <provider> <manual|sticky_session|round_robin|failover> [accountId]
/dockyard use <provider> <accountId>
```

`/dockyard login` opens the provider's official browser authorization page and imports the completed account into the pool without requiring a local CLI. Codex, Antigravity, Grok, Claude, and Cursor use provider-verified browser flows; CLI/desktop/OAuth-file sources remain compatibility or scan fallbacks. Claude can request a manual authorization-code paste when its official hosted callback does not return to localhost. The GUI Login/Add action always starts a new browser flow, even when accounts already exist, instead of silently re-importing the active account. Use `/dockyard scan` plus `/dockyard add` only when importing an existing local session. Completed credentials are written to macOS Keychain and only opaque references reach the account pool or page state.

`/dockyard status` reports `quota.updatedAt` for quota freshness and separately reports OAuth token refresh fields. The background refresh interval is configurable with `DOCKYARD_DSH_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MS`.

The Codex module uses the locally imported OAuth account and the native Codex Responses transport when the DSH pi-ai dependencies are present. Antigravity exposes official session discovery, quota, credits, and live model catalog, while generation uses the provider's native Gemini `streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` transport. Claude, Cursor, and Grok use their provider-native streaming adapters. Cursor browser accounts resolve identity through Cursor's official AuthService and load the account model catalog through its official AvailableModels RPC; the CLI remains a compatibility fallback. Claude/Cursor quota is only shown when their official session status contains real windows; Grok's public provider surface currently has no dependable subscription quota JSON, so Dockyard leaves that field unknown.

Browser-imported accounts are stored as provider-owned official OAuth sessions with opaque credential references. Refresh tokens remain in secure storage so providers with refresh support can renew short-lived access tokens after a DSH/computer restart; provider revocation or protocol changes still require reauthorization. Scanning an existing desktop/CLI session is separate from browser Add, and an existing account never causes Add to re-import the current active session. Provider changes to OAuth endpoints or token fields are treated as unavailable/degraded until verified.

## Isolated local Web profile test

Do not change the normal DSH profile while testing. Install the local bundle into a temporary Web profile/home, then boot the actual Web runner:

```sh
DSH_HOME=/tmp/dockyard-dsh-home dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"   # 仓库根目录
DSH_HOME=/tmp/dockyard-dsh-home dsh web --dump-config
DSH_HOME=/tmp/dockyard-dsh-home dsh web
```

The repository root and `packages/dsh-plugin` both expose the same `@dockyard-dsh/plugin@0.1.2` bundle. `npm run build:plugin` produces the self-contained Node entry and browser client bundle; `npm pack --dry-run` should show only the release entry, client bundle, patch file, and package metadata. GitHub/npm installs use the prebuilt entry or the package `prepare` script.
